Logging and scraping Users-Emails on Github.


About:

This was one of my first jobs on Upwork. 
The client asked to collect information including email adresses about all programmers from Singapore, Taiwan, Hong-Kong who uses Python
programming language and have at least 10 repositories.

To collect email adresses from Github users script needs to login because emails are shown only for logged in users. 
So another part of this script is automated logins.
